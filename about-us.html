                        <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>My name is George Houghton and I'm studying web design and development at Solent University. 
 I am from Winchester, Hampshire in England. I am originally from Mexico but have lived here nearly all my life after being adopted. 
From a very young age I was introduced in to the design world as my dad was a Managing Director at an architect practice. so, we also looking at the design of building where ever we were. I also have a brother who is a Graphic designer and a sister who is a Milliner so there is an artistic and design presence nearby at all time. 
After 5 years of working in the retail sector I decided that I would go back to college and study computer programing. it was from there that I discovered my love for web design. I had originally planned to go in to software development but realised that my strengths were in the UX and UI aspect of the development process. 
I am now in my second year of a three-year course; this website is both going to serve as a part of my assignment and also as my online portfolio.</p>
